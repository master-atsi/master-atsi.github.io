The M2 ATSI aims to train students with a **coherent program** to address
academic and industrial topics in the domains of
- systems and control,
- signal & image processing, and
- the foundations of machine learning with statistical learning, estimation or optimisation.

The courses focus on methodological foundations and recent developments in these
fields, which intervene directly or indirectly in many disciplines such as
optics, medicine, robotics, energy, automotive...

Details about each unit are available [here](https://grist.numerique.gouv.fr/o/atsi/rmrtsDFMHjjc/ATSI/p/27).

## First Semester

The core syllabus covers the concepts that are common to and essential for all
the subjects covered in the master's program, whatever their orientation in
control or signal-image.

### Bloc 5 — Internship

Minimum duration of 4 months between April and August in academic or industrial
environment, with a report and a defense.

## Remarks

Curriculum trains student to research work through dedicated teaching initiatives (seminars, bibliographic work, project, etc.) and a strong Involvement of the associated research laboratories. Part of the training may be given in English.
