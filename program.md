The M2 ATSI aims to train students with a **coherent program** to address
academic and industrial topics in the domains of
- systems and control,
- signal & image processing, and
- statistical learning and related field like machine learning.

The courses focus on methodological foundations and recent developments in these
fields, which intervene directly or indirectly in many disciplines such as
optics, medicine, robotics, energy, automotive...


The following program starts for the start of the 2025-2026 academic year.
