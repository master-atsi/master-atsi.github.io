Statistical learning participate to the fundation of control and signal-image
processing. The master make a strong focus on this point that also part of other
discipline like computer visio or machine learning.

In addition to the core courses {% include control.button %}{% include sig.button %}{% include im.button %}{% include stat.button %}

- [Estimation](/ue/estimation)
- [Optimization](/ue/optimisation)
