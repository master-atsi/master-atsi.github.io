## Course Description

This course adress modern python practices and tools for scientific and
numerical computations. It covers all aspect of the master, from control, signal
and image processing and statistical learning and serve has a support for more
advanced use in the rest of the program. Students will learn how to use
potential of python and the widely used library. The courses suppose a minimal
knowledge in programming and python language. Teaching is mainly done in the
form of practical courses.
