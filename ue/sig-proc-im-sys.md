This course introduces the basic concepts of estimation and detection. For a
better understanding, each of these concepts is illustrated on real problems
related to optical imaging or image processing. This allows in particular to
make more concrete the central notions of noise and optimality of treatments.
The aim is that at the end of this course, a student will be able to formulate a
problem of information extraction in a noisy signal or image in rigorous terms,
to solve this problem in an optimal way, and to evaluate the performance of this
solution.
