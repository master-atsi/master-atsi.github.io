Hybrid dynamics, combining event-based and classical dynamics (in continuous or
discrete time), are common to many physical systems such as transport systems,
production lines, biochemical reactors, neurons, etc. They also give rise to
many control applications: supervised control, gain scheduling, quantization or
sampling effects, network-controlled systems, degraded modes, and so on. The
purpose of this course is to present the basic concepts necessary for the
analysis and control of hybrid systems. It focuses on three formalisms:
switching systems, piecewise affine systems and hybrid automata. Each concept
will be illustrated by an application example from the automotive industry.
