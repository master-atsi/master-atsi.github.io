The objective of this course is to provide tools for the analysis of nonlinear
dynamical systems modelled by ordinary differential equations. These include
engineering systems, such as robotic, automotive, and aerospace systems, but
also biological and socio-economical systems. A key aspect of these equations is
that their nonlinear nature usually prevents the calculation of an explicit
solution. Furthermore, the frequency methods commonly used for linear systems do
not apply in this context. We rely on stability theory to assess the qualitative
behavior of dynamical systems. This course introduces specific stability notions
and analysis tools tailored for nonlinear systems. Furthermore, beyond
stability, these tools also enable to study the systems performance, robustness
to disturbances, and interconnections.
