## Course objective

The objective of this course is to provide tools for the analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems modelled by ordinary differential equations. These include engineering systems, such as robotic, automotive, and aerospace systems, but also, biological and socio-economical systems. A key aspect of these equations is that their nonlinear nature usually prevents the calculation of an explicit solution.

We rely on stability theory to study the qualitative behavior of dynamical systems by introducing specific stability notions and the tools to guarantee them in practice. Furthermore, beyond stability, these tools also enable to study the systems performance, robustness to disturbances, and interconnections. We present fundamental results to study stability of interconnections, the Small Gain Theorem and the Kalman-Yakubovic-Popov lemma.
