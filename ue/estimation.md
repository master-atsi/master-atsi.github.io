The construction of parametric models and the determination of estimates of
the vector of parameters from experimental data is at the core of the activity of
engineers and researchers who wish to analyze physical phenomena, build
software sensors, detect faults in a system, simulate a process, evaluate a
command... The objective of this course is to make students aware of the
difficulties associated with the parametric modeling and identification process,
difficulties they are often not aware of. The course will provide elements of
answers to the following questions: How to build a model of a system? For a
given model structure, will it be possible to determine the value of its
parameters in a unique way? When two model structures are competing, will it
be possible to distinguish them? Once the structure of the model has been
chosen, taking into account the knowledge available a priori, which criterion
should be chosen to estimate the model parameters? How are the optimal value
of these parameters obtained? A set of parameters has been obtained, but is it
really the only one possible? How to quantify the parameter estimation
uncertainty? How should the data collection be organized to obtain the best
accuracy ?
