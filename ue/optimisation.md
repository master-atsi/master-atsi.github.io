The main goal of this course is to provide basic concepts in optimization from
theoretical and practical points of view. The focus is on continuous
optimization methods that play a crucial role in signal and image processing and
in automatic. These methods cover all areas of applications where one seeks to
have a quantitative approach based on performance criteria. We will mention, in
particular, resolution of inverse problems, machine learning, identification of
complex systems, optimal control, ... In all these domains, it is not only
necessary to know how to use efficient optimization algorithms, but also to
think about the structure of the problem.
