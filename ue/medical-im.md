## Course objective

## Course content

- PET basics (more than SPECT) up to classical iterative reconstruction, including uncertainty estimation;
- Tomographic reconstruction methods based on machine learning, in particular Plug&Play and Unrolling.
- Lab session :
    - classical reconstruction (iterative)
    - Plug&Play reconstruction in PET
- MRI concepts and basic principles of MRI data acquisition and image reconstruction
- Classical approaches to accelerated MRI imaging: parallel imaging, compressed sensing, non-Cartesian imaging
- Supervised and unsupervised learning for MRI image reconstruction, Non-Cartesian trajectory learning.
- Lab session
  - Effects of Cartesian and non-Cartesian subsampling in accelerated imaging
  - Image reconstruction in parallel imaging and compressed sensing
- Lab session
  - Deep learning for MRI image reconstruction: unrolled vs. PnP approaches
