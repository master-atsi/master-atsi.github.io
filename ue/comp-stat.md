## Course Description

This course provides an in-depth exploration of the intersection between computational statistics and machine learning with application to signal and image processing. Students will learn how statistical methodologies are applied within machine learning frameworks to develop robust, efficient, and scalable algorithms. The course covers both theoretical foundations and practical implementations, equipping students with the skills needed to analyze and interpret data using advanced statistical techniques.
