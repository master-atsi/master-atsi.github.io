Animal swarms, electric grids, autonomous vehicle formations, interconnected
neurons, sensor networks… all these systems share a crucial feature: their
overall behavior results from a local interaction among many agents. Here,
“local” means that each agent typically interacts with its neighbors only. This
course aims at providing the basics to both analyze and control of such large-
scale networks. In particular, it provides methodological tools to study
interconnection between multiple dynamical agents. It addresses two fundamental
features of such networks: consensus, in which the states of all agents converge
to a common value, and synchronization, in which agents share a coherent
behavior (possibly non-static). These notions will be illustrated via a
selection of case studies.
