## Course Description

This course address modern python practices and tools for scientific and
practical numerical computations. It covers all aspects of the master, from
control, signal and image processing and statistical learning and serve has a
support for more advanced use in the rest of the program. Students will learn
how to use potential of python and the widely used library. The courses suppose
a minimal knowledge in programming and python language. Teaching is mainly done
in the form of practical courses to enable students to become fully operational.
