This course aims to provide students with the basics of some trajectory tracking
control methods with applications to robotics, but also to biological systems.
The methodological techniques will be those of the differential flatness,
particularly adapted to the synthesis of control ensuring the tracking of
trajectories. The course is divided into two parts.

- In the first part, theoretical notions are developed and illustrated through examples and tutorials.
- In the second part, about twenty case studies, based on articles in the literature, are proposed to the students. For each system studied, one or more models are selected and for each, the differentially flat character is examined, a flat output is determined and a trajectory tracking is implemented in python language.
