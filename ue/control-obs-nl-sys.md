## Course objective

This course provides a rigorous introduction to the analysis and design of control systems for nonlinear dynamics, with a focus on both state feedback and output feedback techniques. Key topics include classical ones as feedback linearization, flatness-based control, backstepping and sliding mode. The course also addresses observability in nonlinear systems, introducing tools such as the Extended Kalman Filter and advanced observer designs. Modern nonlinear design methods such as feedforward and passivity-based control are also covered. The course combines theoretical foundations with practical methodologies to equip students with versatile tools for nonlinear system control. Examples from mechanical systems and electrical systems will be provided.
