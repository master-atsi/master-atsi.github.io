Born in the 1950s with the advent of computers, machine learning has recently
experienced a remarkable boom thanks to the availability of masses of data,
great computing power (GPU) and specialized software environments (Deep
Learning). Machine learning techniques have allowed a significant performance
gain on classic problems of interpretation of complex data (image
classification, face recognition, autonomous vehicle driving, speech
recognition, translation, medical diagnosis, biometrics, etc.). This course
consists in a general presentation of the main existing machine learning
techniques, from the most classical to the most recent ones. It puts an emphasis
on the practical implementation of these methods in various application domains
through computer labworks and a project.
