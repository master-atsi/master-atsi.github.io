Model predictive control is an advanced control method, based of models and
optimization (optimal control). It has proven its performance on several
industrial applications (more than 1000 applications identified in the early
2000s). At the same time, the theory has continued to evolve and many advances
have been made, mainly on the improvement of robustness and real- time
performance on the one hand, and on the extension to more complex structures /
objectives on the other hand. The objective of this course is to present the
classical or more recent results on model predictive control, which will allow
the use of this technique as a methodological tool in automatic control. An
important part of the course will be dedicated to the optimization and
implementation aspect, where the taking into account of constraints leads to
solve control problems by real time optimization techniques which are heavy in
terms of computation even if the prediction models are linear. An alternative
solution based on the search for explicit solutions for real-time implementation
will be presented. In the second part, the course will deal with extensions to
cover the notions of robustness of the prediction. Prediction in the presence of
model uncertainties represents the key point of design but the mastery of
computational complexity remains an unavoidable constraint. The course aims to
raise awareness of the use of more complex models that take into account hybrid
or non-linear dynamics in general.
